# USB PHYSICAL SECURITY
In the realm of USB physical security, this project focuses on enhancing data protection by implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) to control the accessibility of USB ports. The system requires users to register and obtain a dynamically generated one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered email address before gaining the ability to block or unblock USB ports. This multi-layered security approach aims to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data through USB devices.The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for managing USB port permissions, offering a convenient way to enhance security measures within an organization or personal computing environment. By integrating OTP verification, the system ensures that only authorized individuals can modify USB port settings, adding an extra layer of protection against potential data breaches or unauthorized data transfers.Overall, this project combines user authentication, email verification, and USB port control to create a robust security solution that prioritizes data integrity and confidentiality in the face of evolving cybersecurity threats.
